## Problem 2:(https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashset/)

Design a HashSet without using any built-in hash table libraries.
To be specific, your design should include these functions:

add(value): Insert a value into the HashSet.

contains(value) : Return whether the value exists in the HashSet or not.

remove(value): Remove a value in the HashSet. If the value does not exist in the HashSet, do nothing.

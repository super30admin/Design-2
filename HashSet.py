// Time Complexity : O(1) for all methods
// Space Complexity : O(n + log(n) )
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : N/A


// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
intitally we declare a primary array of size = sqrt(range of data // 2)
each element of primary array will have a sub array of size = sqrt(range of data // 2)
Basically we have created a nested array.
Whatever the value we get as input, we will sotre it in such a way that value = index in nested array.
So, fetching, adding, and deleting will be done in O(1) time complexity.

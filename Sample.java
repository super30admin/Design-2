Q1)
// Time Complexity : O(n) for pop in worst case and O(n) for push in worst case however the worst case operations 
// are delayed for majority of time and for 100 push operation we get one pop() so amortised cost is O(1)
// Space Complexity : O(n)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : Yes


Q1)
// Time Complexity : O(n/k) which is O(n) in worst case but if we have good load factor and proper distribution the time reduces to
// constant time. For better distribution prime number should be used.
// Space Complexity : O(n)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : Yes

// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach

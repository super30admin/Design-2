// Implement Queue using Stacks
// Time Complexity : push operation -> O(n), pop operation -> O(1), peek operation ->O(1), isEmpty()-> O(1)
// Space Complexity : push operation -> O(n),pop operation -> O(1),peek operation ->O(1),isEmpty()-> O(1)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode :Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : So far so good


// Design HashSet
// Time Complexity : Add operation -> O(1), remove operation -> O(1), contains operation ->O(1)
// Space Complexity : push operation -> O(n),pop operation -> O(1),peek operation ->O(1),isEmpty()-> O(1)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode :Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : So far so good

// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach

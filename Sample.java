// Implement Queue using stacks
// Time Complexity : push - O(n), pop - O(1), peek - O(1), empty O(1)
// Space Complexity : O(n)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : No

// HasSet
// Time Complexity : O(1)
// Space Complexity : O(range)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : I tried solving in C++, but got stuck in pointers implementation

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

Implement the MyQueue class:

void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
Notes:

You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push 
to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. 
You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) 
as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

Constraints:

1 <= x <= 9
At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.
All the calls to pop and peek are valid.


Follow-up: Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized
 O(1) time complexity? In other words, performing n operations will take overall 
 O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer.

#-----------------
# Time Complexity: 
#-----------------
# O(N) for push()
# O(1) for pop(), peek() and empty()

#------------------
# Space Complexity: 
#------------------
# O(N): since we use two stacks for push and one stack for other operations

class MyQueue:
# We can use two stacks to implement the queue.

# One stack stores last item added at the top (in_stack)
# Another stores the first item added to in_stack stack (out_stack)

# Two possible ways: Make push() operation expensive or pop()

# Since an expensive pop() also means an expensive peek(),
# I choose the first approach of making push expensive. How?

# - For every push(), reverse out_stack and store it in in_stack. 
# - Append to in_stack
# - Reverse in_stack and store in out_stack for pop() and peek()
# - For pop() or peek(), pop from out_stack

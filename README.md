## Problem 1: (https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)

/* Push into push stack and when popping or peeking put all elements from push_stack into peek and then pop or peek the top element 
The problem is when we want to push something when pop_stack is not empty
To solve that we push only when pop_stack is empty so we check pop_stack before pushing and if it is not empty we add every element of pop_stack into push_stack and then we push the element.

# Design-2

## Problem 1: (https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)


## Problem 2:(https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashset/)


## solution1 https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/512298518/   
For this, time complexity for push in O(1), and pop and peek is 0(n). Space complexity O(n).

## solution2 https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/512401971/
For this, time complexity for every operation is O(1). Space complexity O(n) worst case (Basically length of first array+length of 2nd array, which translates to 0(n)).
